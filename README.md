Toy Robot Simulator
===================
Description
-----------
- The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,
  of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
- There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
- The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table. Any   movement that would result in the robot falling from the table will be ignore, however further valid movement commands are still allowed.

The simulator can read in commands of the following (textual) form:

    PLACE X,Y,F
    MOVE
    LEFT
    RIGHT
    REPORT

- PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH,
  SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
- The origin (0,0) is the SOUTH WEST most corner.
- The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any
  sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE
  command. The application will discard all commands in the sequence until
  a valid PLACE command has been executed.
- MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is
  currently facing.
- LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction
  without changing the position of the robot.
- REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot on standard output.

- if the robot is not on the table, it will ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT
  and REPORT commands.
- Input is from standard input.
